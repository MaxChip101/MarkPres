#### What is MarkPres?
MarkPres is an application that allows for slideshow presentations inside the terminal.

#### How Does MarkPres Work
MarkPres uses Markdown as a way to make presentations.

For the Markdown format, every `---` indicates a new slide.

To start a presentation you would type `mpres` and your Markdown file to present: `mpres index.md`

You can add flags such as `--presenter-view` to create a new terminal for presenter view.
